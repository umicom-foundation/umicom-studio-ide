  This XML is intentionally minimal so it can be embedded into multiple
  contexts. The surrounding container (a notebook tab, sidebar, etc.)
  provides layout constraints. The label is the user-visible title for
  the pane, and the internal name/id is used by code to locate the widget.
-->
<ui>
  <!-- The 'name' is used by code to look it up; the text is end-user visible. -->
  <pane name="ChatPane">Chat</pane>
</ui>
